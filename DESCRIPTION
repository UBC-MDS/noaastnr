Description: The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) collects and provides access to weather data from land-based weather stations within the US and around the world. One method for accessing these data is through a publically accessible FTP site.  This package allows users to easily download data from a given station for a given year, extract several key weather parameters from the raw data files, and visualize the variation in these parameters over time.
